# **Mamma Koala**

This is a project we developed during the Xilinx Pynq Hackathon at Politecnico di Milano.

We created a code to control a stuffed animal (Mamma Koala) with special features. Our project is aimed at helping
children in hospital.
The main features are:

- activating Mama Koala only when it's dark
- turning on Mama Koala's shiny heart when the baby is crying or when the animal is being shaken


We used a Zybo board (the entry-level Zynq board by Xilinx) and the Pynq  platform (Python on Zynq) to program it.

For further information watch our presentation and our report.
